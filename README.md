# Data Modeling with MySQL

## Overview
This project applies Data Modeling with MySQL and builds an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in JSON format, and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

## Song Dataset
The Songs dataset is a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).

Sample Record :
```	{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}```
